			<p>Including almonds with meals reduces the glycemic idex of the meal,
			and almonds are rich in protein and healthy fats, which are both nourishing

			<p>Almonds are slimming.  A Spanish study found that those who eat
			tree nuts at least twice a week were 31% less likely to gain weight than
			those who don't.</p>
											
			<p>One study found that when included in a heathy diet, almonds can reduce
			C-reactive protein, a marker for inflammation, as much as statin drugs.</p>
										
			<p>Almonds have as much calcium as milk cup for cup.</p>
												
			<p>The massive Harvard Nurse's Health Study found that women who ate
			at least an ounce of almonds a week, which is about 28 almonds, had
			a 25% lower risk of developing gallstones.</p>
			
			<p>Almonds are rich in monounsaturated fats, which is the same
			kind of healthy fat found in olive oil).</p>

			Walnuts are a very rich source of antioxidants.  They have about twice as
			much as any other commonly consumed nut.  And they are the richest nut source of
			alpha linolenic acid, which has been associated with decreased anxiety and depression.</p>

			<p>Walnuts lower both LDL and total cholesterol and improve the elasticity of blood vessels.
			Walnuts are also rich in an unusual form of vitamin-E called called gamma-tocopherol,
			which has been linked to protection from heart disease.</p>
			
			<p>Walnuts reduce the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, which has been linked to
			heart disease, cancer, and other diseases, so the anti-inflammatory effect of walnuts
			may reduce the risk of many diseases.</p>
			
			<p>Walnuts have also been shown to have a slimming effect with study participants
			showing a decrease in fat deposits around the mid-section.  Another study found
			that people that ate nuts were far less likely to be overweight or obese.</p>
				
			<p>Walnuts are rich in key nutrients that are hard to find in other vegetable sources.
			For example, walnuts are one of only a few rich sources of healthy omega-3 oils.
			Another is melatonin, which is critical to sleep
			cycle and internal clock.</p>
