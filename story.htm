			<h1>Our Story</h1>
				
			<h3>By Ron Jones</h3>
				
			<p>Our farm was originally part of the Rancho de Farwell Land Grant.
	  		The land was given to Edward Farwell by the Mexican Governor Manuel 
	  		Micheltorenia in 1844, and it totaled 22,193 acres.  The Grant consisted 
	  		of all the land between what is now the Ord Ferry Road on the south, 
	  		Big Chico Creek on the north, the Sacramento River on the west and Dayton 
	  		Road on the east.</p>
	  			
			<p>After Farwellâ€™s death, James Williams obtained the Rancho de Farwell 
			by petition in 1853.  It was soon split many ways with John Bidwell 
			buying the portions where the city of Chico south of Big Chico Creek now 
			stands.  A man named Rievas bought the 8,000 acres where the M &#38; T 
			Ranch is now located but lost it due to a love of horses.  It was then
			bought by Senator Phelan.</p>
				
			<p>About this same time, Henry Gerke bought various tracts of land in the 
			Grant, but by 1868, he had sold all of it parcel by parcel.  Our ranch was 
			part of the Gerke property, and Mr. E. L. Toy bought it in two different
			parcels.  The first was an 80 acre parcel, and it was sold November 8, 1866
			for seven dollars an acre.  The second, a 96 acre section, was bought on
			September 28, 1868.  After the death of Toy in 1887, the property was deeded
			to his daughter, Mrs. Belle (Toy) Graf.  The ranch remained under the Graf
			name until Belle died, and after her death, her heirs sold the ranch to
			the Coons.</p> 

			<h3>The Coon Years</h3>
			
			<p>The Coon family moved to Chico from Correctionville, Iowa in 1899, and
			in 1913, they loaned $11,000 to Wesley L. Page and his wife in Correctionville,
			and they used the ranch as collateral.  By 1919, a woman named Belle Graf had
			somehow become the owner of the ranch which meant that she now owed this money
			to the Coons.  Then in December of 1919, she gave the Coons a lease with option
			to buy the ranch, and when she died in 1920 the Coons got the ranch after the
			estate was settled.</p>

			<p>Apparently Wesley Page and his wife (the people who originally borrowed
			the money) never made any payments on the note, so in 1920, the original $11,000
			debt had become $14,500, and the Coons used this $14,500 as a down payment on
			the ranch.  On July 19, 1920, the ranch officially became the property of Jasper
			Coon and his two sons, Fred and Allie; although, they still owed money on the
			place.</p>
				
 			<p>They made regular payments on the ranch loan until the Depression started
 			in 1929, but for years they were only able to make interest only payments on
 			the note because of how tough things were economically.</p>
 			
			<p>The Coons also owned some property on Miller Avenue in Chico, and in the
			1930s, they started an almond hulling and shelling business.  By the time WWII
			started, this business became very profitable, so with the money they made from
			that business and by selling the dairy cows at the ranch, they were able to pay
			off the ranch loan.</p> 
			 
			<p>In 1941, Jasper Coon (my great-great-grandfather), died so the ranch was now
			owned by his sons, Allie and Fred Coon (my grandfather).  Then in 1942, the
			brothers decided to part ways; Fred became sole owner of the ranch, and Allie
			took the business on Miller Avenue and a small ranch in Durham.</p>
			
			<p>Upon the death of Fred in 1962 the ranch passed to his daughter, 
			Gladys Jones, and upon her death in 2004, the ranch was inherited by her son, 
			Ron Jones.</p>
